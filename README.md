# Spotify Home Page Clone (HTML & CSS)

## üéµ Project Overview

This repository features a visual clone of the **Spotify Home Page**, built exclusively using **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling. The goal of this project was to meticulously recreate the iconic user interface and design elements of Spotify's landing page, focusing on responsive design and a clean, modern aesthetic.

I've also incorporated a few **small personal touches** to make this clone uniquely my own, while striving to maintain the original's essence.
